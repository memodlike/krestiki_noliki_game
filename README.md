# krestiki_noliki_game

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a krestiki_noliki game written in Flutter. The game is implemented as a StatefulWidget and allows players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either an 'X' or an 'O'. The game checks for a winner after each move and displays a message when the game is over. A restart button is also provided, allowing players to start a new game once the current one is finished. The user interface is built using the GridView and ElevatedButton widgets from the Flutter Material library. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build their own Tic Tac Toe game in Flutter.
